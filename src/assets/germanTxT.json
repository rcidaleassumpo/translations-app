Eine Kindertagesstätte (Kita) ist eine Kinderkrippe oder ein Kindergarten. Dort betreuen Erzieher die Kinder in Gruppen . In einer Kinderkrippe sind Babys und Kinder bis drei Jahre. Der Kindergarten beginnt mit zweieinhalb und endet mit sechs Jahren. In den Kindertagesstätten gibt es aber nicht immer genug freie Plätze für alle Kinder.

Nach einem halben Jahr war Julius dann in einer Kita mit vielen anderen Kindern, bei der Tagesmutter waren es nur vier Kinder. Julius war auch manchmal bis 18 Uhr bei der Tagesmutter. In der Kita muss ich ihn jetzt jeden Tag um 17 Uhr abholen. Das ist manchmal schwierig , weil der Weg von der Arbeit zur Kita sehr lang ist.",

            "Manchmal geht alles schief – so wie heute Morgen bei Inge. Sie steht auf und freut sich auf den Tag. Zuerst macht sie sich einen Kaffee. Als sie damit ins Wohnzimmer geht,  stolpert  sie über einen Gegenstand und verschüttet den Kaffee. Also holt sie den Putzeimer und putzt den Boden. Dann will sie sich einen neuen Kaffee machen. Doch auf dem Weg in die Küche rutscht sie auf dem nassen Boden aus . Dabei hält siesich an der Gardine fest . Als die Gardine zu Boden fällt , reißt sie die Blume von der Fensterbank . Jetzt sitzt Inge auf dem nassen, schmutzigen Boden mit der Blume und der Gardine auf dem Kopf. Plötzlich klingelt das Telefon. Tarek ruft an. Als er hört, was Inge passiert ist, verspricht er ihr: „Ah Inge, du hast einen echten Pechtag. Steig jetzt bloß nicht auf Leitern oder Treppen! Bleib, wo du bist. Ich komme gleich. Ich helfe dir und dann nehme ich dich mit ins Restaurant. Da bekommst du dann endlich deinen Kaffee.“",
            "Wie das Leben vor 200 Jahren war? Ganz anders als heute natürlich. Und was genau war anders? Hier einige Bespiele: Damals gab es keine Waschmaschinen und keine Spülmaschinen – man musste mit der Hand waschen, und das hat gedauert und war auch nicht so hygienisch wie heute. Und gekocht hat man früher auch anders.  Die Menschen hatten keine Elektroherde , sondern mussten Feuer machen. Das war im Vergleich zu heute umständlich . Zuerst musste man Holz sammeln , dann das Feuer machen. Und wenn man daran denkt, dass man heute nur das Licht anmachen muss und Strom im Haus hat ... Früher mussten die Menschen Kerzen anzünden , Heizungen gab es auch nicht, keine Fernseher, keine Computer. Das kann man sich heutzutage gar nicht mehr vorstellen. Heute sitzt man abends vorm Fernseher oder surft im Internet. Früher sind die Menschen früh ins Bett gegangen, weil es ohne Strom gar nicht so lange hell im Haus war. Außerdem mussten viele am nächsten Tag sehr früh aufstehen und arbeiten. Gearbeitet haben die Menschen früher oft viel härter und länger.",

Aber auf Deutsch kann auch ein Satz mit „bitte“ und „danke“ unhöflich sein. Es kommt auf die Intonationan. Man kann einen Satz höflich oder unhöflich betonen , freundlich oder unfreundlich. Leises Sprechen ist meistens höflicher als lautes Sprechen. Auch die Körpersprache kann Höflichkeit ausdrücken . Darf man dem Dialogpartner direkt in die Augen schauen? Das ist in vielen Ländern unhöflich, in Deutschland sollte man es aber machen. In manchen Sprachen, zum Beispiel auf Englisch, ist eine hohe Stimme am Satzanfang höflich.
